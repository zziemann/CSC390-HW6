Assignment 6

1. How long did you spend on this assignment?
 - As usual, this took a very long time, over 2 days long again.  

2. Based on your effort, what letter grade would you say you earned?
A

3. Based on your solution, what letter grade would you say you earned?
A

4. Provide a summary of what doesn't work in your solution, 
along with an explanation of how you attempted 
to solve the problem and where you feel you struggled.

 - This assignment was difficult in a different way this time, the machine I am using to code seemed to
act buggy. The physics seemed to act very strange sometimes and fine others.  I did the best I could with
the hardware I had.  
 - This was one of the more enjoyable assignments even if it was hard and frustrating, learning about physics and animation
 - Part of the reason this seemed so hard is I think that I got stuck on simple parts of the code, 
and really needed to figure that section out before I could move on to more important things. 
I guess partly a problem from being an online class. 

The app is a breakout game. 
The game has a moveable paddle and bricks that are generated from code based on user setting,
like the assignment said.
The user setting screen has 4 custimazations for the game, with the 3 requried UI classes from the requirements.
The ball bounces off walls, paddle, etc.
When you click or touch, the ball gets pushed in a random direction like it is supposed to also. 
The brick collision was not working exactly like I'd like it but it does work usually.
